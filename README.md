## 1. Spin-Transfer-Torque module is finished during my phd degree and published on journal.

## 2. The spin-relaxation dephasing model is implemented in the magnetic tunneling junction using the algorithm proposed by Supriyo Datta paper.

## 3. Double-barrier-magnetic-tunneling-junction is similar to the paper result.

## 4. Magnetic-Tunneling-Junction-momentum-phase-relaxation is used to simulate elastic phonon interaction with electron in the channel. The algorithm is implemented based on this paper. https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.75.081301

Fig. 4.2 NEGF simulation of TMR vs. voltage. The parameters used for this calculation are Ef = 2.25 eV, mup = mdn = 0.73 m0 in FM layer, mup = mdn = 0.32 m0 times the 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 0.8 and1 in oxide layer, LFM = 2 layers for left contact and LFM = 2 layers for right contact, Lox = 4, 6, 7, and 8 layers and m0 is the free electron mass.

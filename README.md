# Magnetic-tunneling-junction


## 1. Spin-Transfer-Torque module is finished during my phd degree and published on journal.
https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/S2010324719500036











## 2. The spin-relaxation dephasing model is implemented in the magnetic tunneling junction using the algorithm proposed by Supriyo Datta paper.

## 3. Double-barrier-magnetic-tunneling-junction is similar to the paper result.

## 4. Magnetic-Tunneling-Junction-momentum-phase-relaxation is used to simulate elastic phonon interaction with electron in the channel. The algorithm is implemented based on this paper. https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.75.081301

The spin-relaxation dephasing model is implemented in the magnetic tunneling junction using the algorithm proposed by Supriyo Datta paper.

Double-barrier-magnetic-tunneling-junction is similar to the paper result.

Magnetic-Tunneling-Junction-momentum-phase-relaxation is used to simulate elastic phonon interaction with electron in the channel. The algorithm is implemented based on this paper. https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.75.081301

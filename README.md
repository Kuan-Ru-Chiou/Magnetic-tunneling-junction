### Abstract : 

Recent study in Ref. 81 showed that the spin-transfer torque (STT) is enhanced by the asymmetry in a graphene lateral spin valve structure. This lateral structure or geometry can be modeled by a four-terminal magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) as opposite to the conventional two-terminal MTJ. In this paper, using the non-equilibrium Greenâ€™s function formalism, we compare the anti-damping components of the STT in a similar non-conventional lateral one dimensional MTJ with that in the conventional MTJ. We find that the lateral geometry renders enhanced anti-damping torques compared with the conventional one, provided that the barrier energy, the scattering length, and the magnetization angle are in a certain parameter region. We also identify this parameter region in the presence of dephasing. The enhancement of the anti-damping torques declines when the scattering region is longer. For the four-terminal MTJ of larger scattering length, the dephasing can expedite the anti-damping torque.
































## 2. The spin-relaxation dephasing model is implemented in the magnetic tunneling junction using the algorithm proposed by Supriyo Datta paper.

## 3. Double-barrier-magnetic-tunneling-junction is similar to the paper result.

## 4. Magnetic-Tunneling-Junction-momentum-phase-relaxation is used to simulate elastic phonon interaction with electron in the channel. The algorithm is implemented based on this paper. https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.75.081301
